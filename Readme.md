# Idle Money - Just a test project for me to exercise in unexplored domains of C++.

## Motivation
This game is inspired by the "Idle X Tycoon" games that can be found on smartphone's stores.
I figured out that, even with my limited knowledge of C++ and the fact that I do not plan to lean GUI in C++, many of these games' aspects could be reproduced.
This repo is just a demonstration of my work and does not have the purpose of being marketed.
